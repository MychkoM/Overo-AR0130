    Release notes for the Aptina AR0130 image sensor linux driver.
    This document contains information on how to download the OS, build
    the driver/OS and how to use the sensor. Please read this document
    before posting questions to the drivers@aptina.com e-mail address.


AR0130 Driver
--------------
    The AR0130 driver is a Video for Linux 2 (V4L2) driver that is compiled
    into the Overo Linux Angstrom distribution. It is distributed under
    the GNU General Public License agreement which can be obtained from Free Software 
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA02139, USA. 


TARGET HARDWARE/SOFTWARE
------------------------
    - Gumstix Overo.
    - Linux Angstrom Distribution, kernel release 3.5.7.
    - Aptina Beagleboard-xM Adapter/Revision 0 and AR0130 1.2-megapixel raw sensor.


DRIVER SOURCE CODE FILES
------------------------
    Driver files and directory locations are listed below:
    ar0130.c, ar0130_data.h, Makefile, and Kconfig are located at:
        git/drivers/media/video

    ar0130.h and v4l2-chip-ident.h are located at:
        git/include/media

    board-omap3beagle.c and board-omap3beagle-camera.c are located at:
        git/arch/arm/mach-omap2


LINUX KERNEL CONFIGURATION/COMPILATION
--------------------------------------
    Copy AR0130 related files into the kernel directories:
        $cp your_ar0130_driver_directory/board-omap3beagle.c		./arch/arm/mach-omap2
        $cp your_ar0130_driver_directory/board-omap3beagle-camera.c	./arch/arm/mach-omap2
        $cp your_ar0130_driver_directory/ar0130.c			./drivers/media/video
        $cp your_ar0130_driver_directory/ar0130_data.h			./drivers/media/video
        $cp your_ar0130_driver_directory/Makefile			./drivers/media/video
        $cp your_ar0130_driver_directory/Kconfig			./drivers/media/video
        $cp your_ar0130_driver_directory/ar0130.h			./include/media
        $cp your_ar0130_driver_directory/v4l2-chip-ident.h		./include/media

    From Yocto enter the command:
        bitbake -f -c menuconfig virtual/kernel 

    In menuconfig, enable the AR0130 driver. The AR0130 driver configuration is at the
    following location:
        "Device Drivers"-->"Multimedia support"-->"Video capture adapters"-->"Encoders/decoders and other helper chips" 

    Select "Aptina AR0130 support" as either
        <*> Aptina AR0130 support
    so that the driver is part of kernel image, or

    Note: other image sensors (such as the MT9V011 or MT9P012) should be de-selected.

    Compile the kernel:
        bitbake -f -c compile virtual/kernel
